## How to Use

To use JS Animator in your own website, place this code in your HTML:
```HTML
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/squareroot12621/jsanimator/css/base.css" />
```
```HTML
<article id="jsanimator">
  <noscript id="scripterror">
    <h2>Uh oh!</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is turned off. To run the JS Animator, enable JavaScript in your browser settings.</p>
  </noscript>
</article>
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/squareroot12621/jsanimator/js/main.js"></script>
```
It's recommended to put the `<script>` at the end of the `<body>` of your website
so that the rest of the website can load first.
